##### New Features in Java 24:



###### 1\. Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch



Till Java 22, pattern matching was primarily applied to reference types. Developers could use pattern matching with the ‘instanceof’ operator to simplify type checks and casting for objects.



Example:

Object value = 3.14;

String result = switch (value) {

&nbsp;   case Integer i -> "Integer: " + i;

&nbsp;   case Double d -> "Double: " + d;

&nbsp;   default -> "Unknown type";

};

System.out.println(result);



Java 24 expands pattern matching to include primitive types in all pattern contexts, such as the instanceof operator and switch expressions and statements. 



double value = 3.14; 

switch (value) {

&nbsp; case int i -> System.out.println("value is an integer");

&nbsp; case double d -> System.out.println("value is a double"); // Not possible before Java 24 

&nbsp; default -> System.out.println("value is something else"); 

}



###### 2\. Flexible Constructor Body

Prior to Java 22, the Java language required that any explicit constructor invocation (super() or this()) appear as the first statement in a constructor. This restriction meant that any initialization or validation code had to occur after these invocations, potentially leading to less intuitive code structures



Enhancements:



class Person {

&nbsp;   String name;

&nbsp;   Person(String name) {

&nbsp;       this.name = name;

&nbsp;   }

}



class Employee extends Person {

&nbsp;   Employee(String name) {

&nbsp;       if (name == null || name.isBlank()) {

&nbsp;           throw new IllegalArgumentException("Name cannot be empty");

&nbsp;       }

&nbsp;       super(name);

&nbsp;   }

}



###### 3\. Module Import Declarations



The module system required code to be organized into modules to take advantage of strong encapsulation and reliable configuration. However, importing modular libraries into non-modular codebases was inconvenient, often demanding workarounds or full migration to a modular system.



Enhancements:

Type-import-on-demand declarations shadow module import declarations.

Modules may declare a transitive dependence on the java.base module.

The java.se module transitively requires the java.base module. Consequently, importing the java.se module imports the entire Java SE API.

This feature bridges the gap between modular and non-modular codebases, facilitating a smoother transition to modularity.



Java 24 refines module import declarations, improving compatibility and reducing potential conflicts when importing modules.



Syntax of Module Import Declaration:



import module moduleName;



###### 4\. Stream Gatherers



The Stream API provided a set of built-in intermediate operations (such as map, filter, and flatMap) for processing data streams. While powerful, these operations could be limiting when more complex transformations were required, often leading developers to write custom collectors or resort to less elegant solutions.



Enhancements:

Java enhances the Stream API to support custom intermediate operations, known as Stream Gatherers. This feature allows developers to create more flexible and expressive stream pipelines, enabling transformations that were previously difficult or verbose to implement.



Example:

Stream<String> stream = Stream.of("a", "b", "c");

Stream<String> modifiedStream = stream.gather(

&nbsp;   () -> new StringBuilder(),

&nbsp;   (sb, s) -> sb.append(s.toUpperCase()),

&nbsp;   sb -> sb.toString()

);

modifiedStream.forEach(System.out::println);



###### 5\. Class-File API

Interacting with Java class files typically required third-party libraries or manual parsing, as there was no standard API for parsing, generating, or transforming class files. This lack of standardization could lead to compatibility issues and increased maintenance overhead.



Enhancements: 

A standard Class-File API provides a unified and reliable way to parse, generate, and transform Java class files. This API simplifies the development of tools and libraries that interact with bytecode, promoting consistency and reducing dependency on external libraries.



###### 6\. Vector API

The Vector API allows developers to express vector computations that compile at runtime to optimal vector instructions on supported CPU architectures, achieving performance superior to equivalent scalar computations.



Example: Vector Addition



VectorSpecies<Float> SPECIES = FloatVector.SPECIES\_PREFERRED;

float\[] a = {1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f, 4.0f};

float\[] b = {5.0f, 6.0f, 7.0f, 8.0f};

float\[] c = new float\[4];

for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i += SPECIES.length()) {

&nbsp;   var va = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, a, i);

&nbsp;   var vb = FloatVector.fromArray(SPECIES, b, i);

&nbsp;   var vc = va.add(vb);

&nbsp;   vc.intoArray(c, i);

}



###### 7\. Quantum-Resistant Module-Lattice-Based Key Encapsulation Mechanism



Understanding ML-KEM:



ML-KEM is a key encapsulation mechanism that allows two parties to securely establish a shared secret over an insecure communication channel. This shared secret can then be used with symmetric-key cryptographic algorithms for tasks such as encryption and authentication. ML-KEM is designed to be secure against potential quantum computing attacks and has been standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in FIPS 203.



Using ML-KEM in Java 24:



Java 24 provides implementations of the KeyPairGenerator, KEM, and KeyFactory APIs for ML-KEM, supporting parameter sets ML-KEM-512, ML-KEM-768, and ML-KEM-1024 as defined in FIPS 203.
